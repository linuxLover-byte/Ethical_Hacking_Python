# What is a Keylogger?

A keylogger is a type of software or hardware that records the keystrokes made on a keyboard.
It is often used for monitoring user activity, capturing sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers, or for malicious purposes like stealing personal data. 
Keyloggers can be installed on a device without the user's knowledge and can operate in the background, making them difficult to detect.
They are commonly associated with cybersecurity threats and privacy violations.





⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠
**Disclaimer:** The use of keyloggers and similar monitoring tools on unauthorized systems is illegal and unethical. 
Always ensure that you have explicit permission from the user or owner of the system before using such tools.
It is recommended to only perform monitoring on your own systems or in environments where you have obtained proper consent.
